# Release instructions
> Depending on the release pattern, a release might already be created and just waiting for review and approval/rejection at a specific job to be deployed into an environment (or cancelled if rejected). If you individually, or through team membership, are listed as an approver for that environment, the below image and button will display above the workflow graph to begin the release process.

*Figure 2: The pop-up that appears to review deployments. These can be approved to progress the pipeline, or rejected if some condition isn't met. This is also where CM numbers, or notes about an eCM could be added to aid in future review.*

**ACTION:** Check boxes for any environments to approve or reject.

**ACTION:** Click "Approve and deploy" or "Reject" for selected environments.
